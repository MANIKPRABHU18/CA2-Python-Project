# üìÆ Indian Post Office Data Analysis (CA 2 Python Project)

This project is part of my Continuous Assessment 2 (CA 2) submission, focused on analyzing real-world data from the Indian Post Office using Python. The analysis explores the distribution, types, and locations of post offices across India through data wrangling and visualization.

## üß† Project Overview

The objective of this project is to:
- Clean and prepare real-world data for analysis
- Visualize the distribution of post offices by type and state
- Explore geospatial and numerical patterns in the dataset
- Generate insightful visual representations such as bar plots, KDE heatmaps, and histograms

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** ‚Äì for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** ‚Äì for data visualization
- **Numpy** ‚Äì for numerical operations

## üìä Key Insights

- Post offices are categorized by types such as Branch Office (BO), Sub Office (SO), and Head Office (HO).
- Major Indian states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have higher post office counts.
- Geospatial visualization highlights dense clusters of post offices in populated regions.
- Pin code distribution gives insight into the coverage of postal services.
